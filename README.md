Project Title : A Book Request web page (using HTML, CSS, JS)

Description: A web page to view the different books present in "The Book Store".
             It shows a snapshot of the book along with name and price.It also
             involves a section for requesting books by providing the book name
             and author details.The javascript then handles generating alert and
             prompt boxes to get the mail id and confirm the request.

I learnt to create a website that looks professional. I also learnt the importance
of deciding the layout of design before the begin of project. And also about how 
the overlapping of different elements happen. I also learnt the importance of javascript
in making the web page dynamic


10 things to improve:

1. Make the layout that displayed the grid of books uniform.
2. Display the author's name along with the title.
3. Add a navbar that also works when in the same element.
4. Add a backgound colour.
5. Make the thumbnail of books smaller.
6. Add 5 books in a row.
7. Make the book store in navbar linked to the top of the page.
8. Style the request section to look more professional
9. Navbar to be displayed on the first div also.
10. Add a checkbox of list to display the ordered books.

•	Should have tested it in other systems rather than only checking it at one system to make sure it works fine everywhere as it is not aligned when I browse it in mine.
•	Each time I place an order for a book the welcome tab is repeatedly appearing which could be avoided.
•	Should have saved all the images using .png extension.
•	Provisions for more than one order could have been given.
•	Should have used an alt attribute so that if the image is missing some text could be displayed.
•	The code could have been commented.
•	The number of books in a row could be more.
•	The navigation tab works only in the home page and not on other pages.
