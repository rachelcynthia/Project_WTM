I learnt to create a website that looks professional. I also learnt the importance
of deciding the layout of design before the begin of project. And also about how 
the overlapping of different elements happen. I also learnt the importance of javascript
in making the web page dynamic


10 things to improve:

1. Make the layout that displayed the grid of books uniform.
2. Display the author's name along with the title.
3. Add a navbar that also works when in the same element.
4. Add a backgound colour.
5. Make the thumbnail of books smaller.
6. Add 5 books in a row.
7. Make the book store in navbar linked to the top of the page.
8. Style the request section to look more professional
9. Navbar to be displayed on the first div also.
10. Add a checkbox of list to display the ordered books.
